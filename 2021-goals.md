# 2021 GOALS

There are two parts to this plan. Teaching, and researching cutting edge UX patterns that can be implemented by wallets in the ecosystem.

## Bitcoin Design Community & Guide

Helping the Guide and Community understand bitcoin payment and privacy protocols as well as serving as a technical + design bridge.

- Improving content relating to privacy and payments in the bitcoin design guide.

## Design Research

Continuing from the 2020 research on discovering ways to create more [consistent and familiar user experience](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux/blob/master/consistent-payment-flow.md) between lightning and on-chain.

Understanding the capabilities of BDK + LDK and finding ways to connect it to user experience. Then communicate that back to places like the Bitcoin Design Community, Guide, Wallet UI Kit, and Photon.

### [Bitcoin Design Abstractions & Advanced UX Patterns](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qIhzGTTFxwRZlvu33Fuwkv70YtJoj-tMHNmS_dt1n6M/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_28)

Making the hard parts of bitcoin easy to use. Improving accessibility to parts of bitcoinâ€™s on-chain and off-chain protocols relating to privacy and payments through abstractions like contacts, and wallet-to-wallet messaging ([see more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qIhzGTTFxwRZlvu33Fuwkv70YtJoj-tMHNmS_dt1n6M/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_28)).

Activities to acomplish this involve research, and creating proof of concepts for the design abstractions that designers and developers can reference in order to understand how they could implement. The overall goal is to have a more unified and interoperable payment ecosystem.

Since these things are more abstract, there will need validated with teams, and prototypes, and presented in workshops. Once matured, they could serve as additional pages to the guide.
