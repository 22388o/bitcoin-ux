# 2021 GOALS

There are two parts to this plan. Teaching, and researching cutting edge UX patterns that can be implemented by wallets in the ecosystem.

## Education

### Coin Selection & Label Management

Creating interactive tools, holding workshops, and creating video content to educate designers and developers about coin selection, batched transactions, and privacy implication of on-chain payments.

### Bitcoin Design Community & Guide

Helping the Guide and Community understand bitcoin payment and privacy protocols as well as serving as a technical + design bridge between projects like BDK, LDK, LNURL, and others.

- Guide / Payments / Incorporating this [existing research](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux) as v2 of the payments content.
- Guide / Helping introduce lightning network into the bitcoin design guide.
- Collaboration / Understanding the capabilities of BDK + LDK and finding ways to communicate that back to places like the Bitcoin Design Community, Guide, Wallet UI Kit, and Photon.

## Design Research

Continuing from the 2020 research on discovering ways to create more [consistent and famillair user experience](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux/blob/master/consistent-payment-flow.md) between lightning and on-chain. Little explorations were done on [subscription style payments](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/Guide/discussions/122), but a lot of foundational UX abstractions that can serve purposess beyond that origional gaol have been discovered and has received favorable responses in the developer forums they have been presented.

### [Bitcoin Design Abstractions & Advanced UX Patterns](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qIhzGTTFxwRZlvu33Fuwkv70YtJoj-tMHNmS_dt1n6M/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_28)

Making the hard parts of bitcoin easy to use. Improving accessibility to parts of bitcoinâ€™s on-chain and off-chain protocols relating to privacy and payments through abstractions like contacts, and wallet-to-wallet messaging ([see more](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qIhzGTTFxwRZlvu33Fuwkv70YtJoj-tMHNmS_dt1n6M/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_28)).

Activities to acomplish this involve research, and creating proof of concepts for the design abstractions that designers and developers can reference in order to understand how they could implement. The overall goal is to have a more unified and interoperable payment ecosystem.

Since these things are more abstract, there will need validated with teams, and prototypes, and presented in workshops. Once matured, they could serve as additional pages to the guide.
