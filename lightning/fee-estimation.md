# Fee Estimation on Lightning Network

How are the fees calculated?

```
Scenario: 
	When a user scans an invoice
	Then I would like to tell them what the estimated fee will be
```

> but generally your node software can find and calculate routes with fees for you, on lnd I think it's queryroutes or something or you can download the entire channel gossip and find routes and calculate the fee by yourself
