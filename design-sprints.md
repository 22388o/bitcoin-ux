# Design Sprints for Bitcoin

### Abstract

While running [Design Sprints for Coinjoins and Privacy](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux/blob/master/coinjoins/design-sprints.md) with @nothingmuch who is one of the authors of WabiSabi its apparent that such deep dives into a protocol with an expert, and having the process be open and transparent can help both parties.

The protocol benefits from someone available to apply Design Thinking methods to some idea, while the designer is able to gain deep understanding of the protocol, and the layer that it is built upon. In the case of WabiSabi, Coinjoins and on-chain transactions.

We utilised some methods from the Design Sprint process such as Expert Interviews, How Might We, Affinity Clustering, User Journey Mapping, Rapid Sketching (Crazy 8s). 

Calls are open and even had people from other projects, as well as users participate in some these activities.

☝️ During the [WabiSabi: Design Sprints for Coinjoins and Privacy](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux/blob/master/coinjoins/design-sprints.md), we brainstormed, sketched, researched and keep notes in [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_knmJ_C0=/) 

### Motivation

We would like to open the process to allow more designers to get involved, and build off of this work.

- After a couple few presentations, it seems like sending people to the Miro board without guidance is very overwhelming.

### Methods

#### Sprint Question

What design problem are we focused on during the sprint?

#### Expert Interviews

> Firstly, in relative terms, talking to experts in the exploratory phase of a project is a more efficient and concentrated method of gathering data than, for instance, participatory observation or systematic quantitative surveys. Conducting expert interviews can serve to shorten time-consuming data gathering processes, particularly if the experts are seen as “crystallization points” for practical insider knowledge and are interviewed as surrogates for a wider circle of players.

#### Persona

In order to set the context for the later design explorations, we try to assume a persona during the expert interviews.

- [ ] Non Researched Persona Criticisms
- [ ] Agree to criticisms
- [ ] Relying on experts
- [ ] Possible palatable solution: Explain how we invited users into the process to gain their feedback

#### User Journey Mapping

We need to explore the paths that persona can / will get to their goal. Identifying an ideal flow and also pain-points they may encounter.

##### NOTES:

- When we create the map it is usually the easiest way to get new contributors to understand all what has been documented.

#### Design Research

`large-participation`

> *Sometimes the best ideas already exist—they simply need to be repurposed, presented in a new context, or combined with other ideas*
>
> *Look for ideas from other industries or fields that relate to your [design] problem.*

This is a point where we can easily open it for drop in participants, does not require much involvment and can be done asynchronously.

#### Rapid Sketching

`engage-community`

Ideas start getting visual — 8 sketches in 8 mins (Crazy 8s). This activtiy is also great for new drop in participants. Perfection is not important thats why the time is limited.

More time for sketching === more complexity. We can repeat this step multiple times in different sessions.

#### Storyboard

We take sketches, highlights from the design research and fit them into the user journey. When we're done we'll have something like a wireframe for each step in the process we are designing for. This is what we can hand to other designers to apply more impressive visual treatments and further explorations with.

#### Summarise

After all is done, time to write documetnation of our learnings through this process so its easier to digest than that messy Miro project board.

#### Present to Community

Present the documentation for consideration to be included in the Bitcoin Design Guide, partially or adapted.

#### Continuity

The discussions and explorations should continue and hopefully live on without the facilitator — 

- [ ] EXPLAIN HOW THIS CAN BE DONE
  *Trying to figure this out now, the summary document and storyboards can be what is necessary to get the conversation going in the Bitcoin Design Community Slack.*
