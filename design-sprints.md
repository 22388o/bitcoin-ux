# Design Sprints for Bitcoin

### Abstract

We utilised some methods from the Design Sprint process such as Expert Interviews, How Might We, Affinity Clustering, User Journey Mapping, Rapid Sketching (Crazy 8s) and even had people from other projects, as well as users participate in some these activties.

☝️ During the [WabiSabi: Design Sprints for Coinjoins and Privacy](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux/blob/master/coinjoins/design-sprints.md), we brainstormed, sketched, researched and keep notes in [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_knmJ_C0=/) 

### Methods

#### Expert Interviews

> Firstly, in relative terms, talking to experts in the exploratory phase of a project is a more efficient and concentrated method of gathering data than, for instance, participatory observation or systematic quantitative surveys. Conducting expert interviews can serve to shorten time-consuming data gathering processes, particularly if the experts are seen as “crystallization points” for practical insider knowledge and are interviewed as surrogates for a wider circle of players.

#### Persona

In order to set the context for the later design explorations, we try to assume a persona.

- [ ] Non Researched Persona Critisisms
- [ ] Agree to critisisms
- [ ] Relying on experts
- [ ] Possible palatable solution: Explain how we invited users into the process to gain their feedback

#### User Journey Mapping

- [ ] [INSERT USER JOURNEY]

#### Design Research

#### Rapid Sketching

### Motivation

We would like to open the process to allow more designers to get involved, and build off of this work.

After a couple few presentations, it seems like sending people to the Miro board without guidance is very overwhelming.

### Methods

- [ ] Video walkthrough of Miro board
- [ ] State the Design Principals
- [ ] Explain the Technical Concepts
- [ ] Explain the User Facing design discoveries
- [ ] Design visual prototypes to illustrate some of the learnings
- [ ] Come up with a Continuity Plan
