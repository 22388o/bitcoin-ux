# Account Formats

There are a variety of ways to make a payment — and formats that those accounts are identified by.

The most abstract would be a “Contact” that has never been inputed manually — (through share contact for example).

The most complex one being when you request, verify, then input and verify the account details yourself.

IBAN (15-32 chars) can have a similar string length to a bitcoin address (26-35 chars) — but as the format has a structure that contains meta data about who is receiving the funds.

The difference with bitcoin is these accounts are not static, you generate one in your HD wallet

Names, Phone numbers, Usernames and Email Addresses are things we have learned to keep in memory — it is a good example of how technology has influenced behaviour.
