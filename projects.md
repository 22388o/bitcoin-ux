### [Consistent Push & Pull Payments on and off-chain](README.md)

`bip21`, `psbt`,`bolt11`

### [WabiSabi: Design Sprints for Coinjoins and Privacy](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_knmJ_C0=/)

Together with [@nothingmuch](https://github.com/nothingmuch) we explore onchain payments and privacy through the lense of [WabiSabi](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WabiSabi/blob/master/explainer.md) a coinjoin protocol in Design Sprint inspired sessions every week. The sessions aim to create Resources that allow designers to explore creative solutions of these technical topics, and are centered around a persona who realises their mental model is incomplete and is also concerned for their privacy.
