# Design Sprints for Coinjoins and Privacy

## Introduction

We started with a question @nothingmuch posted about amount organisation in the Bitcoin Design Slack - and it has lead us down its own rabbit hole of exploring use cases and user flows private payments together.

The challenge became to think of solutions to aid the transition form a early adopter, technical user base to a wider mainstream user base. How might we increase adoption of bitcoin, in a safe way?

## Prinpals

### Consistency

Create a consistent visual language for simmilar objects that is true to bitcoin.

### Famarilitiy
Lots of concepts being used in wallets are technically driven and often get surfaced to users in the interface causing confusion...

### Empathy

- User is education through the software so they can slowly develop confidence by gaining experience.
- Learn what a UTXO is, not imediatly but over time.
- Against the user flow of dumbing things down to make things simple
- Grow with the user
- Time may be a better metric than amount

### Truthful

- Be true to the principals of bitcoin and display that honestly
  - most wallets have a total balance and you spend out of the balance, but thats not how bitcoin works.

### Private

- Separate pseudonymous identities
  - Linking change address
  - Common input heuristic
    - all inputs are the same identity
  - e.g. sending to my mom for example

## Concepts

### Transaction Fragements
### Batching

## User Facing
### Contacts as Labels

### Payment Request

### Send Payment
### Pending Items
