# Tips & BIPs to replicate a familiar payment experience on and off-chain

## Abstract

The objective is to expose Bitcoin designers and wallet developers to use cases, user patterns, data structures and communication relating to payments â€” focusing on users in frontier and developing markets.

There are limitations in the current system that block payments â€” not everyone has access to bank accounts to use modern financial services like Cash App, Strike, Monzo, Visa, etc.

The process will include exploring what takes to make a complete end-to-end payment experience on Bitcoin and Lightning in a way that is familiar, and seamless between the two networks, while finding ways to use these UX patterns as hooks that can maximise the use of transactions; improve the privacy of the payment for example using payment requests for Payjoins, or redirecting the change outputs to refill a lightning channel.

The output will be documentation that is between technical and visual â€” that aims to bridge the divide between design and developers.
