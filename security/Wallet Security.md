## Intro

If you make use of wallets, you probably have heard of private keys and private key management. A private key is a number, usually encrypted, that allows bitcoin to be spent. Private keys are sensitive information that need to be properly secured because if they fall into the wrong hands, all your bitcoin could be stolen. Hence, we could say that ensuring security in wallets is majorly about securing your private key.

This chapter focuses however not on private key management, but on security in the general sense. It looks at existing mechanisms and also best practices that improve and ensure security in wallets.
