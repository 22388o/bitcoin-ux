# Pine bitcoin wallet

## Setting up

- download app from App Store 

- select app icon on homepage 

- splash screen comes up with “create account” and “ recover account” options to choose.
- select “Create account” button but it takes a little loading time

- a screen that prompts users to input a username shows up. From here you can either select  “Cancel” or  “Next”

- on the bottom left corner of this same screen there’s a “change server” option, I do not know what it means

- select “Next” which takes some loading time to display the next screen

- Welcome screen shows the users Pine address, recommends that the  recovery key is kept safe and informs the user of where it is stored, ICloud in this case, and warns that you would not be able to recover account without it. I liked this because it lets you know how important and sensitive the recovery key is.

- welcome screen also has terms and conditions and privacy or which I did not read

- “I understand” button that takes a little loading time when selected 

- allow notifications from the app on iPhone.

- home page comes up

  

## Receiving payment

- users can also add contact by selecting the “add contact icon” on the top left corner

- home screen also has a bottom navigation that contains 3 icons, the icons are not labelled but can be identified as “send”, “message” and “receive”

## Sending Payment 

### Method 1 - scanning QR code

- select the “send” icon and a QR code scanner/ camera screen was displayed 

- an instruction tells users that they can either send or receive bitcoins on this screen by scanning a QR code.*I had initially thought that you could only send from this screen and not receive as well*

- a paste field at the bottom of the screen which has a message attached to it, informing users wether or not they have bitcoin addresses on their clipboard. *I thought this was helpful in a situation where I thought I copied an address but it turned out that I didn’t*.

- no QR code to scan to continue transaction.

  

### Method 2 - Choosing a contact from your list

- select saved contact

- a new screen comes up that prompts the user to add the amout of bitcoins they want to send.
