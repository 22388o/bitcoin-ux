# Coinos Wallet

## Setting up

- go to [coinos.io](http://coinos.io) in browser

- first screen displayed has the wallet balance 

- the default unit is in Satoshi *I see “sign out”  and here, I wonder when I ever signed in so I select the “sign out” button*


- redirected to a “sign in” screen where a user name and password is required 

- There’s also a “create account button”. A username and password plus a password confirmation is required

- select the “create account” button and is redirected to the home screen



## Receiving Bitcoin 

- from the home screen, select “receive payment”

- a screen with a bitcoin address comes up. Here users could either choose Bitcoin, Liquid or lightning. *I chose “lightning”*.

- users can also request for specific amount, add memo and copy the address to share. There is also a “check out” button. *I had assumed that by selecting the checkout button I would be able to share the address to other apps but instead there was an “add tip” button which I didn’t understand*. There was also a cancel button 

- unlike other apps, sharing bitcoin addresses to other apps isn't possible. hence, the address is copied to clipboard and manually pasted in a chat app.



## Sending Bitcoin

### Method 1 - Request without Amount

- select the "send" icon in the bottom nav

- paste the copied address into the designated field.*I noticed that this app did not automatically detect the copied bitcoin address on my clip board*

- More input fields appear below the address field .they are **"Amount"**, **"Fee"** and **"memo"**.*there was also a toggle called "replaceable" which i didn't know what it meant so I left it as it was*.

- I noticed here that i couldn't send amounts below 600 SAT

- With less than 600 SAT in the wallet, the transaction could not be processed

### Method 2 - Request with Amount

- paste the address into the field designated for it

- there is a display that shows the address came with a specified amount

- there is also a field for memo. *which i left empty*

- tap the " send" button and a payment confirmation page comes up, showing that the transaction is successful. *I noticed here that if the request comes with a specified amount that is less than 600 SAT, the payment would go through*
