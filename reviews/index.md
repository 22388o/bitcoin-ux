# Diary studies / Receive and send on iOS

This is a review of the setting up, receiving and sending flows in various Bitcoin wallet applications. Dairy studies were written for each of the wallets and a spreadsheet was prepared to compare the features and payment requests on these apps.

## Notes

Generally, I think this was an interesting task because it gave me a better understanding ( in addition  to the workshop) of bitcoin wallets, how they are designed and the common design trends.

I wrote diary studies for Pine - Bitcoin wallet, Wallet for Satoshi, BRD and [Coinos](http://coinos.io).The diary studies focused on setting up the wallets, receiving, and sending from the wallets.
