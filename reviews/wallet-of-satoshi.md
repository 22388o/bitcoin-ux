# Wallet of Satoshi

## Setting up 

- download the app

- select the icon on the home screen 

- splash screen comes up for few seconds 

- first display is a “welcome to wallet for Satoshi” pop up

- on the top right corner there is a red exclamation mark circle. *my first thought was that there was probably something there that I needed to attend to.*

- select it and a sidenav comes into view and there's a “login to backup” button at the bottom of the side nav.

- select it and a login pop up is displayed, requesting for the user's email address. *I’m not a fan of entering my email addresses to signup for anything so I didn’t like this process*

- enter email and another pop up comes up asking for two login words that had been sent to the user's email. *This again was not a process I liked, I didn’t enjoy going back and forth between my email app and the bitcoin app*

- enter the two words and a confirmation notification comes up saying “ successfully signed in as .....@gmail.com”



## Receive Bitcoin

- on the home Screen there is a “Send/scan” button at the bottom of the screen.

- On the top right users can either “receive” or “buy bitcoins” by selecting either of the buttons.

- select “receive” and a new screen is displayed after loading for a while

-  On the top of the receive screen you can either choose “lightning” or “on chain”. *It’s default is lightening so I left it that way*.

- add custom amount by tapping the “Add custom amount” button.
- There is also a QR code and an address beneath it which is copied to clipboard 
- on the bottom of the screen there is a “share” button
- select chat app and share to selected contact



## Send Bitcoin 

- select “send/scan” button

- Qr code scanner/camera comes up. *I got a bit confused here because on this app, there was no field to paste in an address if you didn’t have the QR Code to scan, unlike the other apps*

- on the top left corner, there is a “photo icon”.

- select the photo icon and photo gallery is displayed. *Here although without explanation on what to do next from the app, I assumed that I was supposed to upload a picture of the QR code*

- copy payment request address from chat app

- automatically, the app detects a copied payment request link in the users clipboard and displayed the payment request on the screen. *I thought this was cool, as opposed to manually pasting the copied address yourself*

- users can either “cancel” or “pay”

- select “pay”

- payment processed for some seconds

- a “payment confirmation” screen is displayed 

- the home screen comes up with users new balance
