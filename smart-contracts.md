# Smart contract use cases

[MiniScripts](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript) -- Given a combination of spending conditions, MiniScripts are able to derive the most economical script to implement it.

- Abstract it so a wider set of users can create their own payment conditions
- Recipes for users to create more complex payment conditions
- Multi Signature
- Pooling Funds (susu)?
- Too much power for the user? No recorse if a user creates a time lock of 100 years

#### Multi Party Money

- Supporting ways people use money in groups,
- Susu (informal lending club)
- P2P Investments (multi signature)

#### Payment Groups

- Who decides the order for money to be delivered
- Paying for dinner or trips
- Fundraising
  - Payment conditions if a balance reaches a certain amount by a certain time

#### Multi Sigs

- have a very distinct footprint
- Lots of complexity
- P2P Trades use multisig escrow

#### Signature Aggregation Across devices

- User Experience implications of Schnorr Signatures and multi sigs, how to some of the other proposed patterns make this easier to interact with

#### Recovery & Security

- Timelocks

### Streaming Payments

### User Research

- Are there any use cases that simple smart contract logic can be applied to.
