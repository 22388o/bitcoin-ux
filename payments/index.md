## Motivation

There are limitations in the current system that make payment services inaccessible in many places in the world — not everyone has access to bank accounts, identification, proof of address or are in countries which support the use of modern financial services like Cash App, Strike, Monzo, Visa, etc.

The objective is to expose Bitcoin designers and wallet developers to use cases, user patterns, data structures and communication relating to payments — focusing on users in frontier and developing markets.

The process will include exploring what takes to make a complete end-to-end payment experience on Bitcoin and Lightning in a way that is familiar and seamless between the two networks, while finding ways to use these UX patterns as hooks that can maximise the use of transactions; and improve the privacy of the payment. An example would be using payment requests for Payjoins, or redirecting the change outputs to refill a lightning channel.

## Output

The output, is documentation and tools that is between technical and visual — which aims to bridge the divide between design and developers.
