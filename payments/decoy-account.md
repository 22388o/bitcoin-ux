# Fake/Panic Balance

Panic balance is a safety feature that was introduced in a digital bank’s mobile application primarily to protect their customers from police extortion in Nigeria. 

## Apps that make use of it

“[**Kuda bank**](https://kudabank.com/)” is one of the digital bank applications that makes use of the Panic Balance /Fake Balance feature as well as the hide balance. Others banks and wallets make most use of the Hide balance feature.



## How it works

The following steps describe how a customer would set up and use the panic balance feature on Kuda banks app.

- LoginGo to security then select “private mode”
- Select “panic balance”
- Enter a value for the balance you would like to see displayed
-  Shake device to activate and use subsequently 



## The reason

For as long as I can remember SARS has been a major problem for Nigerian citizens, most especially the younger generations. From extortion to illegal arrests, to murder, they have further increased the insecurity in the country. 
Unfortunately, the tech industry has been the major victim of SARS brutality with young techies earning a lot at companies like paystack, Flutterwave or working remotely for companies outside the country.
Sadly, this isn’t a concept that these officers of the law and a lot of the older generation understand, and because of this, young techies are being likened and mistaken as internet scammers simply because they own laptops, drive good cars, and earn a lot of money. The result of this is that they are illegally arrested, extorted, sometimes forced to pay large amounts of money for bail, made to make false police reports or at worst they are killed because they refuse to adhere to their demands.



## How designers can protect users

1. Use a password or pin each time a person leaves the app... maybe 10 minutes inactive you’d be logged out. This would be the flow
  - Login to the app
  - Uses app for sometime
  - Leaves app for more than 10 minutes then is logged out
  - Returns to app
  -  Login Pin/password is requested to continue the session 
2. Stronger passwords recommendations
  - user enters password choice
  - password doesn't meet strength requirements
  - app recommends better/stronger passwords
3. Account authentication (sending a key to a registered phone number)

4. Notifications on unusual login 

   

## Decoy  Account

In case of an attack, a user can switch between their main account to a decoy that has a lesser amount than the main.

## Ways to activate

We've come up with two ways in which a decoy account can be activated.

### Method 1 - Special Pin

Normally in most wallets, users are requested to enter a certain pin to access this wallet. Hence the idea behind this solution is that users can formulate a second pin which instead of giving access to the main account with all the funds, it  opens up the decoy account which may have a lesser amount.

#### How this works

- opens app
- pin is requested
- enters pin of decoy account (depending on their need at the time)
- gets shown your wallet balance and transactions ( if you have any)
- carry out your transaction as though it was your main

#### Pros

- suppose the user was under attack, this method seems more believable to the attacker
- it is also more convinient to use

#### Cons

- the user may not remember to put in the decoy account pin when they are under attack. They maybe too frightened or be more focused with staying alive.
- it may cause suspisions if no previous transactions have been made on that account



### Method 2 - Shaking phone to activate

This method would involve the user shaking their phone, while in the wallets interface
