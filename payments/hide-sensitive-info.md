# Hiding sensitive information in bitcoin wallets

## Abstract

Imagine this scenario. You are  in a public place, you need to open up your bitcoin wallet to maybe make a payment but you don't feel comfortable enough to have your wallets information displayed on your phone screen once the wallet is opened. This here a problem because you probably want to feel safe whenever they use your wallets.

Privacy in bitcoin wallets goes far beyond hiding balances and other sensitive information  but it is clear that they also play a part in it. By giving users the ability to hide the information they want to,  they gain an added sense of privacy and security when they have the ability to control when and who sees their information on the wallet.



## How information is hidden on bitcoin wallets

Although the hiding information pattern isn't incorporated on many bitcoin applications, a few wallets like wasabi, wallet of satoshi, etc. have made it work in the following ways.



### Tapping on the balance to hide and reveal it. 

In this method, the hide icon / button is usually displayed within close reach of the balance itself. you can quickly and easily hide your information by tapping on this icon / button. Now, this method, though quick and easy to use, doesn't provide the user with much privacy. ***Wallet of satoshi***, ***Edge***  and ***Luno*** wallets implement this method of only hiding the wallet balance. What this means is that all other transactions, addresses, and other information that you may want to keep private, are still very much visible.

#### pros

- Quicker for the user to hide and unveil the information

#### cons

- It doesn't do much for security if every other sensitive information is still displayed on the screen.
- Anyone other than the user can easily reveal the balance



### Tapping on the Hide icon hides balances , addresses  and transactions 

This method of hiding or veiling sensitive information is the most thorough as not only the balance is hidden but also the addresses and the transactions. Wasabi wallet is one of the only wallets that implements this method. ***Wasabi wallet*** also  makes it convenient for the user to do this by clicking on one just one icon that then hides all the sensitive information.

#### Cons

- the hidden information can easily be revealed.



## Screenshots from some wallets and how they hide information

### Wallet of Satoshi

On this wallet,  when the hide balance is selected, the balance on the home screen is hidden as well as the conversation rate but the payments made and received are still very much visible on the home screen. 

#### How it works

- Launch app
- open side nav
- select "advanced settings"
- select "hide balance"

### Edge wallet

On this wallet,  there is no "hide balance" button or toggle. By tapping on the balance, it becomes hidden then a large "show balance" is displayed on the screen. This doesn't do so well for security.

#### How it works

- launch app
- tapping on the balance hides it automatically

## Why is this pattern important to designers?

The [***privacy by design***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_by_design) framework states that privacy should be incorporated / built into products by default. This way, whether or not the user is concerned with their data privacy, they would always be protected through the design. 

By including the hiding information pattern in design of wallets, we give users more sense of control and comfortability in any environment when they use the app. They have the freedom to decide whether or not they want their information visible.
